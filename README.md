# Lightbox-js
A JavaScript that implements the functionality of helping the client view the image in a modal window.


Why did I want to create it? I wanted to create it because I was interested to suspend my workflow, quickly preview webpages dedicated to forms of media and transiton back; otherwise, I was required to add 100+ tabs on lets say, a website that sells paintings because the browser renderes images in a conventional manner by default. In technology, lightbox js is a better way of doing things and offers scalability that saves time and effort.
